This dataset was collected on December 20, 2024 at Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China, and the collection site is about 300m*350m.

We arranged five fixed-position anchor points at the edge position of the test site, and the GPS coordinates of the anchor points are given in the GPSCoordinatesofAnchorPoints folder, and the anchor points are used for the reception of RSSI data.We collected a total of six fixed test points as well as two segments of test points with moving positions.We plotted the collection scenario as a satellite map, and we collected the RSSI data through real-time measured GPS coordinates to establish a planar rectangular coordinate system.

The data collected for the fixed test points are in the six TestPoint folders, which also give the GPS coordinates of the test points as well as the time stamps of the collection and the RSSI values, where the RSSI values are in dBm (decibel milliwatt).

We made the pedestrian carrying the transmitting device move at a constant speed and collected RSSI from two mobile test points. We also gave the GPS coordinates of the start and end points of the mobile test points and plotted the path of the movement on the graph, and the data and GPS coordinates are stored in the MobileTestPoint folder.
